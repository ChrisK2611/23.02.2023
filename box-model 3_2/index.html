            <h2>Decorating with plants is simple</h2>
            <p>To create the most ineresting display, use amixture of plants iszes and leaf shapes. A large plant like Pippa the peace lily, mixed with something sculptural like Susie the snake plant and a soft fern like Bertie gives an attractive range of textures. Hanging plants, like Rapunzel the golden pothos, add interest at different heights. Don't forget your pots. Matching pots will look clean and elegant, while a mix of styles an patterns looks eclectic an fun.</p>
